  abstract = {Availability of a transit service is a key factor in a traveler's choice of transportation mode. Transit service is a realistic option only if the service is available at or near locations when a person plans to travel. Whereas various measures exist for transit availability such as service frequency, the focus of this study was on the spatial aspect of pedestrian accessibility to transit stations, that is, on service coverage. Service areas are commonly used to visualize accessibility for pedestrians to transit systems and to analyze the potential ridership. Because the service area for a station is defined over the maximum network walking distance from a transit station, a complete street network that includes pedestrian segments, that is, shortcuts, is highly important for a realistic assessment of service areas. Whereas most proprietary geodata providers concentrate solely on car-related geodata, public domain street data and volunteered geographic information, such as OpenStreetMap, provide a potential valuable source for pedestrian data. The authors compared the amount of pedestrian-related data between freely available sources (OpenStreetMap or TIGER or both) and proprietary providers (Tele Atlas or NAVTEQ or both). The effect on modeling transit accessibility for pedestrians was analyzed for five U.S. and four German cities, and differences between these two countries were identified.},

The primary hypothesis tested is that transit trip-making is higher in urban environments that are more conducive to non-motorized travel, given that bus transit systems are most frequently accessed via walking or biking. A secondary goal is to contribute to an improved understanding of the measurement of the built environment in geographic information systems (GIS). A composite measure of walkability---incorporating land use mix, density and street patterns---was developed for all transit stops in San Diego's Metropolitan Transit Systems service area and used as a measure of the built environment. Findings indicate a small but significant, positive relationship between the walkability of the built environment and transit ridership.},

  abstract = {In the past several decades, planners and policy makers have focused on creating more balanced transportation systems that included better transit service as well as improved options for pedestrians and bicyclists. Pedestrian accessibility is vital to the success of this mode because transit users are likely to walk on at least one end of their trip. As a result, practitioners have focused on improving pedestrian environments in station areas. Pedestrian accessibility studies have focused on formal pedestrian links such as roads, sidewalks, and multiuse trails. However, a small but important body of literature suggests that the informal pedestrian environments play an important but often overlooked role in pedestrian accessibility. Social paths are informal routes that emerge in grassy areas because of footfall. Social paths have formed at numerous suburban transit stops and show deficiencies in the design of formal pedestrian networks. Because current travel behavior studies omit informal pedestrian networks, their results may be inaccurate and result in misguided policy. This study identified social paths at 12 light rail stations in Denver, Colorado, and Dallas, Texas. With two pedestrian accessibility metrics, the formal pedestrian environment was compared with a joint formal--informal pedestrian environment that includes social paths. This study makes the argument that social paths are important components of station-area pedestrian accessibility and should be incorporated into future travel behavior studies and pedestrian improvement projects.},

  abstract = {We investigate the associations between walking patterns and street network structure in the context of transit station development intended to create its own demand rather than serve existing demand, and an urban morphology dominated by gated communities in station areas. We record the complete actual walking routes of 3637 metro users from station exits to their destinations. We then extract pedestrian access behaviour from these routes, summarised by link use density measured by pedestrian volume on each road segment; and route detour measured by deviation from the shortest access path. We unravel the impact of two design elements in station areas on the observed pedestrian access behaviours: street network structure measured by network centralities; and gated community layout measured by the degree of gatedness, numbers, and geographic size. The route detours and network centralities are calculated based on a complete pedestrian network that includes pedestrian paths inside the gated communities. The results show that network structure significantly impacts link use density. The higher the betweenness of a link (a network measure of connectivity to shortest paths), the higher the volume of metro riders using it. The main reason for pedestrians leaving metro stations on routes that deviate from the shortest access path was the presence of gated communities. The results suggest that in countries like China where metro station development is used as a land development and urban expansion strategy and where gated neighbourhoods are a common development typology, a policy to selectively open up gated communities to more permeable pedestrian flows would be in the interest of station access with attendant benefits, by deduction, such as promoting metro ridership and increasing population health. The research framework and key findings of this study are transferable to transit developments throughout China and in similar developing contexts.},

A critical component of any navigation system is a map database, which represents a network (e.g., road networks for car navigation) and supports key functionality such as map display, geocoding, and routing. Road networks, mainly due to the popularity of car navigation systems, are well defined and publicly available. However, in pedestrian navigation systems, as well as other applications including urban planning and physical activity studies, road networks do not adequately represent the paths that pedestrians usually travel. Currently, there is a void in literatures discussing the challenges, methods, and best practices for pedestrian network map generation. This coupled with the increased demand for pedestrian networks is the prime motivation for development of new approaches and algorithms to automatically generating pedestrian networks. Three approaches, network buffering, using existing road networks, collaborative mapping, using Global Positioning System (GPS) traces collected by volunteers, and image processing, using high-resolution satellite and laser imageries, were implemented and evaluated with a pedestrian network baseline as a ground truth. The results of the experiments indicate that these three approaches, while differing in complexity and outcome, are viable for automatic pedestrian network map generation. The recommendation of a suitable approach for generating pedestrian networks for a given set of sources and requirements is provided.},

  abstract = {A wide range of analytical methods applied to urban systems address the modeling of pedestrian behavior. These include methods for multimodal trip service areas, access to businesses and public services, diverse metrics of ``walkability'', and the interpretation of location data. Infrastructure performance metrics in particular are an increasingly important means by which to understand and provide services to an urbanizing population. In contrast to traditional one-size-fits all analyses of street networks, as more detailed pedestrian-specific transportation network data becomes available, the opportunity arises to model the pedestrian network in terms of individual experiences. Here, we present a formalized and city-scale framework, personalized pedestrian network analysis (PPNA), for embedding and retrieving pedestrian experiences. PPNA enables evaluation of new, detailed, and open pedestrian transportation network data using a quantitative parameterization of a pedestrian's preferences and requirements, producing one or more weighted network(s) that provide a basis for posing varied urban pedestrian experience research questions, with four approaches provided as examples. We introduce normalized sidewalk reach (NSR), a walkshed-based metric of individual pedestrian access to the sidewalk network, and sidewalk reach quotient (SRQ), an estimate of inequity based on comparing the normalized sidewalk reach values for different pedestrian profiles at the same location. Next, we investigate a higher-order and combinatorial research question that enumerates pedestrian network-based amenity access between pedestrians. Finally, we present city-scale betweenness centrality calculations between unique pedestrian experiences, highlighting disagreement between pedestrians on the ``importance'' of various pedestrian network corridors. Taken together, this framework and examples represent a significant emerging opportunity to promote the embedding of more explicit and inclusive hypotheses of pedestrian experience into research on urban pedestrian accessibility, multimodal transportation modeling, urban network analysis, and a broader range of research questions.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the accessibility scoring approach applied by the Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT) in the Smart Scale project prioritization process in 2018. The accessibility scoring approach identifies the increase in jobs accessibility for candidate projects submitted for state funding. The Smart Scale process was implemented in 2015 and entered its third round of applications in 2018; some 800 projects were evaluated during its first two years. This paper contains the following elements: an general overview of jobs accessibility as defined and measured by Virginia DOT for the Smart Scale approach; the development of the Smart Scale accessibility scoring system, including a summary of research performed to identify system parameters; the relationship between mobility and accessibility; and the Smart Scale accessibility transferability to other locations and initiatives and the possible evolution of the Virginia DOT approach in the future.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian route choice (PRC) is influenced by a wide range of factors, yet an understanding of the trends, patterns, and findings of PRC research is a gap in the literature. The present study applied the PRISMA framework to systematically identify published studies on PRC. The identified studies were synthesized by answering the systematic classification scheme (SCS) questions. Results show that prior studies have used a total of 105 factors associated with PRC. The identified factors were categorized under three groups (i.e. pedestrian socio-demographic factors, built environment factors, trip characteristics). The findings of this systematic review identified several critical research gaps for studying PRC behaviour. Future PRC research should aim to determine the influence of social, physical, and individual factors associated with PRC and the nature of the relationships of those factors with PRC.},
