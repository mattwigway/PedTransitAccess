  Evaluating changes to transit service using accessibility metrics is increasingly common. However, these metrics are almost always used to evaluate changes to the transit service itself. Almost every transit user is also a pedestrian at some point when accessing or egressing from a stop. In this article, I apply an automated algorithm to identify locations in the pedestrian network where adding an additional link would improve transit accessibility. I then evaluate these locations in terms of their impact on accessibility to jobs via transit, combining both the pedestrian network and the transit service to evaluate the real-world impact of these changes.

  Improving accessibility via transit through street network improvements is an attractive proposition, because unlike service improvements street network improvements have minimal ongoing costs. Furthermore, many pedestrian network improvements (e.g. crosswalks or sidewalks) are relatively low cost compared to capital investment in transit service.

# Introduction

Accessibility metrics are increasingly used in transportation planning [@miller_accessibility_2018; @cotam_2020], and particularly in public transit planning [@conway_evidencebased_2017a; @conway_accounting_2018; @conway_getting_2019; @santanapalacios_unpacking_2025; @pereira_transport_2018; @herszenhut_impact_2022b; @wu_urban_2021]. These metrics measure the potential access to opportunities afforded by the transportation system—in their simplest form, this might be something like "a person at this location can reach 200,000 job opportunities within 60 minutes on public transportation."

Most often, accessibility metrics are used in transit planning to evaluate the impacts of changes to transit service. However, the vast majority of transit users walk to transit [@cignarella_onboard_2023], meaning the pedestrian environment around stops is also very important to understanding transit access. Modern accessibility analysis tools model the walk to transit as well as the ride time, often using OpenStreetMap data, so the pedestrian environment is not completely discounted. However, transit access tools are primarily applied to measure impacts of changes in transit service; it is rare to model transit access impacts of changes to the pedestrian network.

Much post-war development in the United States is characterized by disconnected street networks, cul-de-sacs, and sparse pedestrian infrastructure. This type of street network design can significantly reduce the catchment area of bus stops. For instance, @fig-catchment shows a 20-minute walk from two bus stops in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. The dark line indicates the theoretical maximum catchment if one could walk in a straight line in any direction. The shaded area shows the actually reachable area. On the left, a stop in downtown Raleigh is shown; since downtown has a well-connected, gridded street network, the reachable area approaches the theoretical maximum. On the right, a stop in suburban north Raleigh is shown; the reachable area is significantly smaller.

![Catchment areas of two bus stops in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA](figures/catchement.png){#fig-catchment fig-alt="Maps showing reachable areas on foot around two bus stops in Raleigh, NC. On the left is a stop downtown, while on the right is a stop in the northern suburbs. A 1.2 km crow-flies buffer around each stop is shown. The area actually reachable using the pedestrian network is shaded. Downtown Raleigh has an extensive gridded pedestrian network, so the reachable area is similar in extent to the crow-flies buffer. In the suburbs, the pedestrian network is more disconnected, so the reachable area is significantly smaller than the buffer."}

This vast difference in catchment areas between these two stops suggests that targeted investments in the street network could improve transit access without ongoing increases in operational costs, by enabling the existing transit service to connect to more people and places. @bhagat-conway_close_2025 introduced an algorithm to identify "low-hanging fruit" missing links in the pedestrian network. Specifically, this "Missing Links" algorithm identifies locations on the street network that are close together geographically, but far apart in network distance. It then scores those links based on their contribution to accessibility. In this article, I apply and extend this algorithm to identify potential links that could improve access to public transit stops, and then evaluate the most-highly-ranked links using a traditional accessibility metric generally applied to transit service changes. I apply the extended algorithm to the Research Triangle region (Raleigh/Durham) of North Carolina, USA, to identify locations where additions to the pedestrian network could increase transit access.

# Literature review

A prerequisite for using public transit is that transit stops must be readily accessible from both the origin and the destination of the trip. Most transit users walk to access transit. Walking distances vary, but many transit agencies assume that riders will walk up to 400 m to access transit, possibly more for higher-quality transit [@walker_basics_2011]. A recent review article found widely varying typical walking distances to transit for different types of service and in different geographic areas [@vansoest_exploring_2020]. Even within a single metropolitan area, walking distances vary based on the built-environment context as well as rider characteristics [@el-geneidy_new_2014].

Most research on the pedestrian environment around transit stops has focused on methods for calculation of the catchment areas of transit stops. Different methods and network data for calculating catchment areas can produce different results [@macias_alternative_2016; @zielstra_comparative_2011]. Others have looked at how catchment areas relate to ridership. @guerra_halfmile_2012 found that different calculation methods did not have a strong impact on ridership forecast quality. @ryan_pedestrian_2009d found that the quality of the walking environment in the catchment area was related to ridership, however. @sun_unravelling_2020 found that network centrality measures were strongly predictive of walking routes in catchment areas, and that gated communities can significantly affect the ability of riders to walk directly to transit. 

Several studies have focused specifically on augmentation of the pedestrian network to enlarge catchment areas. @gallagher_missing_2013 found that community-created informal paths play a significant role in this at suburban light rail stations. Most studies of catchment areas are descriptive, but @lahoorpoor_catchment_2020 evaluated the possibility of adding additional entrances and exits to rail stations, and found that these scenarios could significantly increase access to transit.

Relatively few studies have focused on the impact of catchment areas on overall access to destinations via transit. @vaneggermond_pedestrian_2016 evaluated access to jobs via transit using different specifications for the catchment areas, and found that it can significantly affect measured access.

Accurately modeling how the pedestrian network affects transit access of course requires accurate pedestrian networks. Pedestrian network data tends to be less well maintained than street centerline datasets, and this can have significant affects on access [@zielstra_comparative_2011]. There are a number of automated methods for generating pedestrian networks, including buffering street centerlines, deriving networks from GPS traces, and using computer vision. While these are feasible, they do not provide a perfect representation of the network [@karimi_pedestrian_2013a]. Given the network effects of any link in a sidewalk network, however, and additions or omissions may have a large impact on the results. This led @bhagat-conway_close_2025 to develop their network manually.

OpenStreetMap is one potential solution, but there is still significant variation in the coverage of sidewalk data. Furthermore, there are two ways sidewalks are mapped in OpenStreetMap, which may affect results: some sidewalks are treated as features of the road, and annotated on the road itself, whereas others are mapped as separate paths [@omar_crowdsourcing_2022]. This particularly has implications for street crossings; sidewalks on opposite sides of the street may not be connected by crosswalks, but this is difficult to infer from sidewalks that are tagged as features of the road itself.

Even with perfect network data, it is still necessary to determine what streets are considered comfortable places to walk; some streets with no pedestrian infrastructure may feel very safe, while other streets with low-quality pedestrian infrastructure may not. Safety, traffic volumes, infrastructure quality, and local neighborhood characteristics are all associated with pedestrian route choice [@basu_systematic_2022]. Some analysts take a weighting approach, assigning preferences to particular edges based on their assumed quality [@hardy_accessibility_2019]. The weighting approach, however, can be problematic when combined with transit; it may result in choosing a slightly longer path to a bus stop for a marginal improvement in comfort, even if this means the rider misses the bus and has to wait an hour for the next one [@bhagat-conway_routing_2024]. Further complicating matters, this varies individual-to-individual. @bolten_routine_2021 use separate pedestrian subnetworks based on personal preferences, but this is rare and computationally demanding.

# Methods and data

I source pedestrian network data from OpenStreetMap. Most OpenStreetMap-based routing engines take a fairly lenient approach in terms of pedestrian path generation: they allow walking on any road where pedestrians are assumed to be legally allowed (i.e. most roads, excepting freeways/motorways and those explicitly tagged as not allowing pedestrians).

Since this work focuses on improvements to the pedestrian network, I want to use a network of links where pedestrians are likely to feel comfortable walking, rather than all places they are legally allowed to walk. To approximate this network, I filter the OpenStreetMap data to only ways that have a highway type of

- footway,
- cycleway,
- pedestrian,
- track,
- sidewalk,
- service,
- road,
- steps,
- path,
- crossing, or
- residential,

as well as those that are tagged as having sidewalks or are explicitly tagged as allowing pedestrians. This leads to a somewhat disconnected network in suburban areas. This disconnected network is a better representation of the lived experience of pedestrians in suburban areas of the Research Triangle. Unlike Bhagat-Conway et al., I do not remove "islands" with very few vertices. Many of these islands are residential streets connected only to a large arterial and thus are representative of the fragmented nature of the network. A representative portion of the network is shown in @fig-network (this and all other maps are created using the R `{tmap}` package [@tmap]). Unlike @bhagat-conway_close_2025, I do not break long edges into shorter pieces, as this complicates inserting identified links back into the OpenStreetMap data for further analysis.

![A portion of the network in southwest Durham, North Carolina. The walkable streets included in the network are shown in black.](figures/network.png){#fig-network fig-alt="A suburban street network, with sidewalks and minor street shown in orange. Major streets are not walkable and thus are not highlighted, creating a disconnected network."}

One limitation of this approach is handling crossings, which were a significant portion of the links identified by @bhagat-conway_close_2025. If a residential street crosses an arterial, this approach will assume there is a safe crossing, since the residential street is continuous and considered walkable.

\FloatBarrier

The accessibility algorithm requires that all origins and destinations be associated with a node, so I insert all bus stops in the region into the network. If they are near an existing node, I assign the stop to that node. If they are within 20 meters of an existing edge, but not near an existing node, I insert a node into that nearby edge. Lastly, if they are not near any edges (e.g. stops that are on streets without sidewalks), I add two nearly-coincident nodes, and a "phantom" edge between them. The algorithm only identifies missing links between edges, so this phantom edge allows the algorithm to connect these stops to the network. Transit stop and schedule data are sourced from GTFS data from the five major transit operators in the region: GoDurham, GoRaleigh, GoTriangle, GoCary, and Chapel Hill Transit.

I then apply the Missing Links algorithm to this network, identifying locations where there are points on the network that are within 100 meters geographically and at least 500 meters apart on the network. This process identifies hundreds of thousands of potential links in the region, though many provide effectively the same access. I use the deduplication method described in @bhagat-conway_close_2025 to reduce this to a more manageable amount.

The identified links are based only on the network topology, without reference to the location of transit stops. The final step of the algorithm is to score the links based on their contribution to accessibility. Tolerance for distance to transit is usually assumed to be between 400 m and 1 km; I take the upper end of this range and use the an accessibility metric based on stops accessible within 1 km. Since some stops are more valuable than others, I weight stops by the number of trips serving them on a typical weekday. Note that high scoring links are often near transit stops, but this is not required; a link several hundred meters away could score highly if it completes or shortens a path to the stop.

Specifically, the overall access to transit provided by the network is

$$
\displaystyle\sum_i \sum_s p_i w_s f(d_{is})
$$ {#eq-access}

where $i$ is an index of all nodes in the graph, $p_i$ is the number of housing units assigned to each node, $w_s$ is the weight (number of trips) assigned to stop $s$, and $d_{is}$ is the network distance from node $i$ to stop $s$. Housing unit data is block-level data from the 2020 Census, evenly divided among each edge in the Census block. Since node weights are required, the weight of each edge is allocated evenly between its two nodes.

$f(d_{is})$ is the impedance function, which in this case is simply

$$
f(d_{is}) = \begin{cases}
  ~~1 & d_{is} < 1~\mathrm{km} \\
  ~~0 & \mathrm{\textit{otherwise}} \\
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-cutoff}

The weight assigned to a stop is the number of vehicles that serve that stop on a typical weekday, so stops that are served more frequently will have a higher impact on overall accessibility. Similarly, stops that serve a larger number of housing units will have a greater impact on overall accessibility. I rank the identified links based on the impact each link individually has on the accessibility in @eq-access.

The Research Triangle network is much larger than the Charlotte network used by Bhagat-Conway et al. [-@bhagat-conway_close_2025], with 573,000 vertices and 672,000 edges (as opposed to 140,000/160,000). In initial testing, I found that identifying, deduplicating, and scoring links in this large network had unsatisfactory performance. However, since pedestrian accessibility is only affected by the network in the local area, I solve this problem by partitioning the network into 24 sub-networks in a regular grid.

To avoid edge effects, I buffer each grid cell by 1.1 km. I only retain links where at least one end is in the main part of the grid cell, rather than in the buffer, to avoid finding spurious links or scores caused by edge effects. Since the links are no more than are 100 m long and accessibility is based on transit stops within 1 km, there is no way a portion of the network beyond the 1.1 km buffer could affect the link or its score. This guarantees that link identification and scoring is identical whether using a partitioned graph or a complete graph. Since the link deduplication process is greedy (i.e. sensitive to the order of the identified links), which links are selected to represent groups of similar links may vary slightly. The original ordering is arbitrary, so this is not expected to materially influence results.

It is important to differentiate access to transit from access _via_ transit. Access to transit measures the ability to get to a bus stop, while access via transit measures what destinations you can actually get to using the street network and transit system. For instance, providing access to a bus stop that is served by a bus that does not go to many destinations is much less valuable than providing access to a bus stop that connects to a large portion of the city's transit network.

Links ranked highly by the Missing Links algorithm have a strong impact on accessibility _to_ transit, but accessibility _via_ transit is generally more interesting. Evaluating the accessibility via transit for such a large number of links is computationally chanllenging. Instead, I take the 100 links that are ranked most highly, and I create a modified version of the input OpenStreetMap data that includes these links. I then evaluate accessibility to jobs within 60 minutes via transit, to understand how these links that increase access to transit also increase access using transit.

I use the `r5r` package [@pereira_r5r_2021a; @conway_evidencebased_2017a] to perform accessibility via transit calculations, using the GTFS data described above as well as the modified OpenStreetMap pedestrian network data. I calculate the number of jobs accessible within 60 minutes, based on the median travel time for departures between 7:00 and 9:00 AM on a weekday [see @conway_accounting_2018 for details]. I retrieve data on block-level job locations from the 2023 US Census Bureau Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset.

By default `r5r` connects a stop to closest street segment, as long as there is any street segment within 1.6 km. For this project, I modified `r5r` and the Conveyal $R^5$ routing engine that powers `r5r` to instead connect stops to segments that are within 20 m, to match the logic used in finding missing links (the modified versions are `r5` commit `996dd94` and `r5r` commit `71cf120`). This way, `r5r` will correctly calculate the accessibility impact of proposed links that connect a stop to a nearby street (for instance, a sidewalk connecting to a stop along an arterial that does not have pedestrian infrastructure). I also modified `r5` to retain all islands, as was done in the link identification algorithm, rather than its default of only retaining islands with 40 or more vertices.

# Results

After deduplication, the algorithm identified 94,000 potential new links in the pedestrian network. Of these, 25,000 have an access-to-transit score of more than 0, indicating that they potentially improve access to the transit network. Identifying and deduplicating the links took 76 minutes on an M1 Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM.

## Impacts of a single link

The first stage scores links based on the number of stops they provide access to, while the second step evaluates the aggregate impacts of high-scoring links on transit access. One of the links that scored highly in the first stage is shown in orange in the left pane of @fig-link. This link is a crossing of Glenwood Avenue in Raleigh in front of a the Tribute Apartments on the northeast side of the street, and is the 23rd-highest-scoring link; it is chosen for further analysis as it provides a compelling demonstration of the algorithm. Glenwood Avenue is a fairly typical high-speed suburban arterial with minimal pedestrian infrastructure. As the map shows, here there is a sidewalk on the southwest but not on the northeast side of the street. There is relatively frequent bus service along this street (15 minutes, among the most frequent service in the region). For residents of the development on the northeast side of Glenwood Avenue, it is fairly easy to access the bus stop for service traveling northwest. However, there is no infrastructure to allow them to safely cross the street to travel southeast. The link identified by the algorithm is shown in orange, and would provide such a crossing.

![Link that scored highly in the first stage and enables access to a large number of additional destinations](figures/single_link.png){#fig-link fig-alt="Two-pane map. On the left, a satellite image of an arterial road is overlaid with sidewalk data showing a sidewalk only on one side, and no safe crossings. It is also overlaid with bus stops, and catchment areas for the stop under existing conditions and with the link shown in orange added. Adding the link allows the catchment area to cross the street. On the right, a much more zoomed out map showing much of the region, showing that you can access a larger area from the apartment complex within 60 minutes on transit with the link added, particularly in the dense downtown Raleigh core."}

The left pane of @fig-link also shows the catchment area of the stop shown in red, which is on the southwest side of the street, and provides access to buses traveling southeast towards downtown Raleigh. Under the existing conditions (dark blue), there is no access to the development on the northeast side of the street. Adding a crossing of Glenwood Avenue here would increase the catchment area of this stop to include the development on the northeast side of the street.

The right pane of @fig-link shows the reachable area via transit from the development under existing conditions and with the proposed crossing added to the network. There are no changes to the transit service in this scenario; the only change is the addition of the proposed crossing of Glenwood Avenue. The development the link connects to is highlighted with a red star. There is a significant expansion in reachable area to the north, east, and south thanks to the addition of the safe crossing. Previously it was not possible to board a southeast-bound bus from this development, as there was no way to cross the street; the reason areas to the south and east are not completely inaccessible in the baseline is because it would be possible to ride a bus the wrong way and then transfer to the opposite direction bus somewhere where it is safe to cross the street.

The link is shown in its local context in @fig-linkphoto. The location of the proposed link is highlighted in red, and the two bus stops as well as the entrance to the neighborhood are highlighted. This is clearly a challenging location to add a pedestrian crossing—Glenwood Avenue is essentially a freeway here, with a center median barrier, along with limited sight distances due to topography. There is a signalized intersection approximately 400 m north of this location, so perhaps extending sidewalk infrastructure to that location and providing a safe crossing there would be more realistic. This also demonstrates the challenges planners face in trying to reconnect and pedestrianize networks that were built for the exclusive use of private cars.

Even without making any changes to the transit service, adding this one key link to the street network has a large effect on transit accessibility for people living in this location. This clearly demonstrates that there are opportunities to improve transit access, and thus transit ridership, through physical infrastructure, and that this algorithm is a reasonable way to identify these possibilities.

## Regional results

The previous section evaluated the results of adding a single link to the network. However, the Missing Links algorithm identifies thousands of potential locations to add links. Individually evaluating the contribution of each of these links to job access _via_ transit is not computationally feasible using current algorithms. However, the Missing Links algorithm does score each of these links with their contribution to access _to_ transit stops. I use this as a heuristic and select the top 100 links based on this metric. I then add these top 100 links to the OpenStreetMap network and evaluate changes in job access _via_ transit.

It is computationally feasible to evaluate the effects of each of these 100 links on job accessibility via transit individually. However, for brevity, in this work I only compare existing conditions to a network where all of the top 100 links are added. I evaluate the accessibility impacts using a regional location-based access to jobs metric; for every Census block in the region, I evaluate the number of jobs accessible via transit within 60 minutes, for departures between 7 and 9 am, under existing conditions and with the links added.

These links are shown in red in @fig-regional. While it appears there are less than 100 links, this is because even after deduplication links tend to cluster, something also observed by Bhagat-Conway et al. [-@bhagat-conway_close_2025]. The impact of the new links on job access via transit is shown in blue, with darker blue areas indicating a larger change in access. Increases in access range from just a few hundred jobs—possibly new access to a single suburban office park—to more than 10,000 (for instance, in a situation where a location has no transit access at all before the link is added).

![Change in jobs within 60 minutes via transit](figures/regional.png){#fig-regional}

As one might expect, the largest increases in accessibility are near the links. However, smaller changes are spread throughout the region. Residents who do not live near a link may still benefit from that link if it connects them to destinations, or even if it makes a transfer easier. This also demonstrates why it is not sufficient to only consider access _to_ transit; closing missing links may make transit journeys easier even for people who do not live near those links. Combining the Missing Links algorithm with a jobs access _via_ transit measure is critical to understand the full impact of a link.

# Discussion

This article has demonstrated that there is potential to improve accessibility via transit through investments in the street network, and that the Missing Links algorithm provides a practical and computationally feasible way to identify candidate locations. It also demonstrates that it is important to evaluate effects on accessibility via transit, not just accessibility to transit, to understand the full impact of these investments.

Improving transit access via street network investments has several attractive fiscal properties. Unlike investing in more frequent or extensive service, street network improvements are a one-time investment. Once the network improvement is made, it will improve access indefinitely with minimal additional commitment of funds. Similarly, investing in the street network is capital rather than operating cost. Some grant funds are restricted to capital rather than operating investments. If extensive right of way acquisition or grading are not required, the cost to add connections to the network is also small compared to other transit capital investments. This is not to say that investments in service are unsound, but that it makes sense to also invest in the pedestrian network to ensure that service dollars provide the best accessibility they possibility can.

On the other hand, built environments change slowly, and once land is subdivided it can be very difficult to acquire right of way for new connections. It is much cheaper and easier to provide for these connections when street networks are first laid out. In fast-growing areas such as the Research Triangle, many new subdivision street networks are planned each year. It may be valuable to apply a tool such as this one to identify potential network changes to improve transit accessibility before plans are approved. Ideally, this exercise would be done using forecast rather than current transit service. Similarly, when planning a new bus or fixed-guideway transit route, applying this algorithm may help identify connections that could be added to the surrounding street network to maximize the impact of the new service.

# Future research

While this research does evaluate job accessibility via transit, idenfication of top-scoring links is done using a much simpler access to transit stops metric. This simpler metric does not fully capture the experience of being a transit user. If those stops connect you to a bus line that doesn't run frequently or serve many destinations, they are not very useful. Similarly, gaining access to a bus stop on a line you cannot currently access is much more valuable than gaining access to a second or third bus stop on a line you can already access. A true access via transit measure would account for both of these things.

One of the key algorithmic innovations that makes Bhagat-Conway et al.'s [-@bhagat-conway_close_2025] algorithm tractable is that it directly evaluates the difference in accessibility for each link, without needing to re-calculate accessibility estimates for the whole network. This requires that link costs not change over time–saving 5 minutes (or 500m walking) has the same effect on the trip regardless of where it was saved. This is not true for transit; a path that saved 5 minutes of walking time might save an hour overall if it let you get on an earlier bus.

An intermediate step is to measure access to routes rather than stops. Currently, the Missing Links algorithm works with undirected graphs, which is generally an appropriate way to model pedestrian networks. One-way pathways for pedestrians are rare. If the algorithm were extended to work on directed graphs, a zero-length edge could be added from every stop along a route to a node that represented the route itself, and those nodes could be considered destinations. Thus, paths that connect people to additional stops on the same routes would not score highly. This requires an algorithm implementation with a directed graph because the edges connecting to the route nodes must all go _to_ the route node, rather than _from_ it. Otherwise, the route nodes could be used as "shortcuts" to allow people to teleport to any location along the route from any stop [cf. @humagain_would_2020].
